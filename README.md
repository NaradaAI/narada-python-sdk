# Narada Python SDK

The official Narada Python SDK that helps you launch browsers and run tasks with Narada UI agents.

## Installation

```bash
pip install narada
```

## Quick Start

**Important**: The first time Narada opens the automated browser, you will need to manually install the [Narada Enterprise extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/enterprise-narada-ai-assi/bhioaidlggjdkheaajakomifblpjmokn) and log in to your Narada account.

After installation and login, create a Narada API Key (see [this link](https://docs.narada.ai/documentation/authentication#api-key) for instructions) and set the following environemnt variable:

```bash
export NARADA_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>
```

That's it. Now you can run the following code to spin up Narada to go and download a file for you from arxiv:

```python
import asyncio

from narada import Narada


async def main() -> None:
    # Initialize the Narada client.
    async with Narada() as narada:
        # Open a new browser window and initialize the Narada UI agent.
        window = await narada.open_and_initialize_browser_window()

        # Run a task in this browser window.
        response = await window.dispatch_request(
            prompt='/Operator Search for "LLM Compiler" on Google and open the first arXiv paper on the results page, then open the PDF. Then download the PDF of the paper.',
            # Optionally generate a GIF of the agent's actions.
            generate_gif=True,
        )
        print("Response:", response["response"]["text"])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This would then result in the following trajectory:

You can use the SDK to launch browsers and run automated tasks using natural language instructions. For more examples and code samples, please explore the [`examples/`](examples/) folder in this repository.

## Features

- **Natural Language Control**: Send instructions in plain English to control browser actions
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple browser tasks simultaneously across different windows
- **Error Handling**: Built-in timeout handling and retry mechanisms
- **Action Recording**: Generate GIFs of agent actions for debugging and documentation
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for efficient operations

## Key Capabilities

- **Web Search & Navigation**: Automatically search, click links, and navigate websites
- **Data Extraction**: Extract information from web pages using AI understanding
- **Form Interaction**: Fill out forms and interact with web elements
- **File Operations**: Download files and handle web-based documents
- **Multi-window Management**: Coordinate tasks across multiple browser instances
